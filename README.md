# Text Compression to JavaScript

Compressor.js compresses a text file into a JavaScript (Node.js) script. When you run the script it decrompresses the text and writes it to a seperate file.

There is also a Python3 script called: `process.py`. It cleans the files of some symbols that the compressor cant handle...

## How to run

1. `node compressor.js input.txt compress.js`
2. `node compress.js output.txt`
3. `cat output.txt`
